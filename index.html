  <h1>Abstract</h1>

<!--  <p>-->
<!--    Supply chain operations and the world of transportation are often hidden from the general-->
<!--    public, that is until disaster strikes or an eagerly awaited online purchase is delayed. The-->
<!--    complexity of the global supply chain can make it unfathomable to track when "things go wrong",-->
<!--    items are "lost in the mail", or how an entire truck trailer could "vanish". For professional-->
<!--    supply chain managers and logisticians, even with the availability of abundant internal and-->
<!--    external data sets, it can be difficult to communicate the right information to stakeholders or-->
<!--    to investigate data and determine broken links in the supply chain.-->
<!--    <br>-->
<!--    <br>-->
<!--    For organizations responsible for the defense and security of a nation's citizens, economy, and-->
<!--    strategic interests, a firm understanding of logistics and transportation operations is-->
<!--    essential. This project seeks to develop new innovative visualization approaches to improve the-->
<!--    presentation of logistics data and tools to examine chokepoints in the maritime supply chain for-->
<!--    the-->
<!--    <a href='https://www.volpe.dot.gov/'>-->
<!--      United States Department of Transportation Volpe National Transportation Systems Center-->
<!--      (Volpe)-->
<!--    </a>-->
<!--    and the-->
<!--    <a href='https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-defence'>-->
<!--      United Kingdom Ministry of Defense (UKMOD)-->
<!--    </a>.-->
<!--    <br>-->
<!--    <br>-->
<!--    The proposed supply chain visualization approach focuses on a case study developed for Volpe and-->
<!--    the UKMOD support a hypothetical shipment from London to the UK Overseas Territory of Bermuda-->
<!--    utilizing commercial maritime carriers.-->
<!--    <br>-->
<!--    <br>-->
<!--    In this case example, UKMOD needs to evaluate commercial shipping options between the UK and Bermuda across 6 ocean-->
<!--    carriers, 9 services, 18 deployed vessels, and their network of ports. The vessels included-->
<!--    several Container/Roll-On Roll-Off (ConRo), geared container vessels, and fully-cellular-->
<!--    container vessels actively deployed on the Trans-Atlantic and US-Bermuda trade lanes.-->
<!--    <br>-->
<!--    <br>-->
<!--    Publicly available schedule, port, vessel, and service information was sourced by the student-->
<!--    team from ocean carrier websites. It was stored and organized using industry practices. AIS-->
<!--    vessel information pertaining to the 18 vessel was supplied by Volpe to support the-->
<!--    visualization.-->
<!-- <br>-->
<!--    <br>-->
<!--    Bermuda is an overseas territory reliant on the United Kingdom for protection and assistance.-->
<!--    Should the UKMOD need to send supplies or materials to the island by sea, options include: 1) deploying a military or merchant vessel from the UK fleet; 2) chartering or-->
<!--    contracting of an available vessel from the international market; or 3) using a commercial cargo-->
<!--    carrier with existing service.-->
<!-- <br>-->
<!--    <br>-->
<!--    There are of course other supply chain solutions available, however, for the purpose of this-->
<!--    case study, the scope is limited. Of these options, shipment of goods between the UK and Bermuda-->
<!--    via an existing commercial ocean carrier service most likely would be the most cost effective.-->
<!-- <br>-->
<!--    <br>-->
<!--    There are no regularly scheduled direct UK to Bermuda ocean shipping services. All inbound and-->
<!--    outbound oceangoing container cargo between the UK and Bermuda requires transshipment in the US.-->
<!--    It is important for the UKMOD to be aware of any possible option and connectivity between the-->
<!--    Bermuda Territory. For example, during the Covid-19 crisis, global disruptions of all modes of-->
<!--    parcel and cargo shipments impacted Bermuda. As a result, all mail between the UK and Bermuda-->
<!--    since May 18, 2020 has been sent via ocean container.-->
<!-- <br>-->
<!--    <br>-->
<!--    Currently there are 3 ocean carriers with regular service between North America and Hamilton,-->
<!--    Bermuda, each operating a single vessel:-->
<!-- <br>-->
<!--    <br>-->
<!--    Bermuda Container Line operates the MV Oleander a ConRo vessel and is the only weekly-->
<!--    roro service. The vessel calls on the Maher Terminal at Port Elizabeth of the Port Authority of-->
<!--    New York and New Jersey. BCL’s management company Neptune Group has a stake in the associated-->
<!--    line Somers Isles Shipping Ltd. BCL connecting carrier agreements include Atlantic Container-->
<!--    Line and Hapag-Lloyd.-->
<!-- <br>-->
<!--    <br>-->
<!--    Bermuda International Shipping Ltd. operates the MV Bermuda Islander weekly and calls a-->
<!--    private marine terminal in the Port of Salem, NJ. BISL is affiliated with Meyers Agencies and-->
<!--    has connecting carrier agreements with Independent Container Line.-->
<!-- <br>-->
<!--    <br>-->
<!--    Somers Isles Shipping Ltd. operates the MV Somers Isles between the Port of Fernandina-->
<!--    Beach, FL on two voyages every three weeks. SISL is affiliated with BCL through the Neptune-->
<!--    Group. SISL is also affiliated with Meyers Agencies.-->
<!-- <br>-->
<!--    <br>-->
<!--    Ocean Carriers in the Trans-Atlantic Trade-->
<!-- <br>-->
<!--    <br>-->
<!--    Independent Container Line is a carrier with a single service between the US and-->
<!--    Europe. Their port call in Chester, PA is ~30 mile truck dray from the Bermuda Islander Terminal-->
<!--    in Salem, NJ. In fact, BISL is a ICL affiliate. ICL is regarded as a niche carrier and had 100\%-->
<!--    schedule reliability for FY 2020.-->
<!-- <br>-->
<!--    <br>-->
<!--    Atlantic Container Line a subsidiary of Grimaldi is also a niche carrier in the RoRo-->
<!--    and container LoLo market. ACL received 73.7\% schedule reliability for FY 2020. ACL is a unique-->
<!--    operator with an extensive UK maritime history. Until recently, its ConRo vessels capable of-->
<!--    moving cargo similar to the UK merchant flag RoRo fleet were under the British flag. ACL’s A-->
<!--    service utilizes its own fleet of dedicated vessels on a set service rotation allowing for-->
<!--    select additional port visits on request for oversize cargo. ACL cooperates with other carriers-->
<!--    like Hapag-Lloyd in slot and vessel sharing agreements on non-ACL owned fully-cellular container-->
<!--    vessels in the carrier’s AL1, AL2, and AL3 services.There is also some overlap for the ACL AL3-->
<!--    and the HLUS US Flag P1/AL3.-->
<!-- <br>-->
<!--    <br>-->
<!--    Hapag-Lloyd USA is the US Flag subsidiary of Hapag-Lloyd AG(HLC). This US flag carrier-->
<!--    is a vital component supporting sealift capabilities of the US DoD and NATO allies. HLC is a-->
<!--    member of Transport High-Efficiency (THE) Alliance along with ocean carriers Yang Ming and Ocean-->
<!--    Express Network (ONE). There is some overlap and alternative port rotations between HLUS US Flag-->
<!--    services, HLC independently operated services, THE shared services, and service partnerships-->
<!--    between HLC and ACL on the AL1, AL2, and AL3 services. Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, global-->
<!--    ocean networks have been severely disrupted. In January 2021, global schedule reliability-->
<!--    dropped to a record low of 34.9\% with Hapag-Lloyd only scoring a reliability of 33.69\%. There-->
<!--    have been other Covid impacts directly impacting the US Flag Atlantic Service such as confirmed-->
<!--    cases on two of the vessels.-->
<!-- <br>-->
<!--    <br>-->
<!--    The Scenario and Visualization-->
<!--     <br>-->
<!--    <br>-->
<!--    In a hypothetical scenario, we imagine that all 6 ocean carriers in the Bermuda and-->
<!--    Trans-Atlantic trade lanes are “in network” and partners with the UKMOD. Due to complexity in-->
<!--    acquiring reliable schedule data, we will only be looking at a single service for each carrier.-->
<!-- <br>-->
<!--    <br>-->
<!--    We also assume a special partner 3PL coordinates freight forwarding, transshipment, and drayage-->
<!--    between US or European terminals. Even with a 3PL handling all NVOCC (Non-Vessel-Operating-->
<!--    Common Carrier) duties, the UKMOD is interested in understanding information about the-->
<!--    connections available in the network of companies they work with. Although a partner carrier may-->
<!--    be responsible for the vessel operations of the services, the UKMOD wants to understand some-->
<!--    granular key performance information relevant to individual vessels and ports.-->
<!-- <br>-->
<!--    <br>-->
<!--    Using the service and carrier information, we seek to visualize the cargo network. We will then-->
<!--    attempt to add some vehicle-level performance information first for the US-Bermuda lane. Some of-->
<!--    these metrics could include speed of vessel, transit time, time in port, etc. Since the Bermuda-->
<!--    carriers have a fixed schedule and limited port calls, it will be easier to extract relevant AIS-->
<!--    information from one or all three with limited pre-processing to visualize metrics about a-->
<!--    particular ship’s voyage.-->
<!--     <br>-->
<!--    <br>-->

<!--    Depending on the difficulty and time constraints of our course project, we may attempt to-->
<!--    extract similar vessel performance metrics from AIS data for the identified Trans-Atlantic-->
<!--    carriers. In this event, we might start with Independent Container Linedue to ICL’s on-time-->
<!--    reliability performance record.-->
<!-- <br>-->
<!--    <br>-->
<!--    Extracting vessel performance information for the Atlantic Container Line and Hapag-Lloyd-->
<!--    services from AIS data likely is too difficult without global schedule data and advanced machine-->
<!--    learning and data mining techniques. It most likely would be outside the scope of the project.-->
<!--    This is due to global ocean carrier network dynamics, carrier alliances and slot sharing-->
<!--    agreements, some possible irregularity due to some specialty and RoRo cargo carried on the-->
<!--    services, and major port congestion issues.-->
<!-- <br>-->
<!--    <br>-->
<!--    That being said, it may still be interesting to look at the AIS data for exploratory analysis.-->
<!-- <br>-->
<!--    <br>-->
<!--    Although this proposed case study is entirely hypothetical and makes some assumptions regarding-->
<!--    UKMOD logistics operations, freight forwarding agreements, and some existing ocean carrier-->
<!--    partnerships, we hope this approach can avoid potential sensitives regarding contracted military-->
<!--    vessels while still supporting the Volpe Center’s work. The end result could serve as a relevant-->
<!--    example for the UK MOD for visualization modules within the suite of Volpe designed logistics-->
<!--    software platforms.-->
