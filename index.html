  <h1>Abstract</h1>
  <p>
    The Container Express also known as the CONEX, was introduced by the United States Military during the Korean War
    as an intermodal logistics platform to improve cargo flows and operations throughout supply chain networks. The 
    CONEX and Malcolm McLean's intermodal container were simple freight technology concepts that revolutionized 
    supply chains. Containerization and the equipment utilized to transport goods efficiently have fostered 
    globalization and made the modern world. However, supply chains remain vulnerable to disruption and are plagued 
    by poor visibility and difficulty exchanging information about cargo and freight networks. Supply chain 
    disruption and the complexity of maritime and hinterland networks remain key issues around the world. SeaCONEX 
    is not just a portmanteau, but a visualization tool focused on this larger issue by allowing users to see the 
    connections of maritime supply chain networks. In this paper, we present a visualization dashboard that allows 
    users to evaluate carrier service rotation between terminals, view the shortest navigable marine route between 
    connections, and investigate vessel trajectories and deviations from the optimal route.

  <h1>Visualization</h1>
  <p>
    The visualizations below depicts a hypothetical scenario where the UKMOD is trying to transport a shipment from 
    London to the UK Overseas Territory of Bermuda. In this case study, UKMOD needs to evaluate commercial shipping 
    options between the UK and Bermuda across 6 ocean carriers, 9 services, 18 deployed vessels, and their network of ports. 
    The vessels include several Container/Roll-On Roll-Off (ConRo), geared container vessels, and fully-cellular container 
    vessels actively deployed on the Trans-Atlantic and US-Bermuda trade lanes.
  </p>

  <p>
    To support the two important tasks of 1) examining connectivity between ports with seemingly disjoint carrier networks 
  and 2) tracking vessel trajectories based on AIS data; we present two views that allow users to accomplish these tasks.
  The first view shows connections between ports in a node-link diagram and allows users to filter routes based on 
  carriers. The second view allows users to examine actual paths taken by vessels and their deviation from the shortest
  or most ideal routes in red.

  <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>

  <p>
    For the node-link diagram, we chose a very simple rendering. Marine terminals are in blue and, and when 
    selected, change color to red, taking advantage of the pop-out effect which brings attention to terminals of interest. On hovering over a marine 
    terminal, users can see more details like the name of the marine terminal and the carriers that operate 
    their vessels there. The advantage of the node-link diagram is that it removes geographic interference, 
    allowing the user to focus clearly on which ports are connected, without worrying about the distance 
    between them, ocean conditions between them, etc. This can help remove bias on "best" or "most connected"
     ports, and just examine the data.
